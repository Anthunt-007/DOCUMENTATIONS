The strlen() function in C is a standard library function that calculates the length of a null-terminated string. It takes a pointer to the first character of the string as input and returns the number of characters in the string, excluding the null terminator.

How it works:

Initialization: The function starts by initializing a counter variable (often named len) to 0. This variable will keep track of the number of characters encountered.
Iteration: The function then enters a loop that iterates through each character of the string until it encounters the null terminator ('\0'). In each iteration:
The value of the current character is checked.
If the character is not the null terminator, the counter variable (len) is incremented by 1.
Return value: Once the loop terminates (when the null terminator is found), the function returns the final value of the counter variable. This value represents the length of the string.


Key points:

The function takes a constant pointer to a character (const char *str) as input, indicating that it won't modify the original string.
The while loop continues as long as the current character is not the null terminator.
The len variable is incremented in each iteration, counting the characters.
The function returns the final value of len, which represents the string's length.
